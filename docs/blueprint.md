# **App Name**: AutoDocify

## Core Features:

- Codebase Upload: Users can upload their codebases as .zip files or paste GitHub repository URLs.
- AI-Powered Code Analysis and Prompt Generation: Use LangChain or custom parsers to extract function definitions, comments, and routes, and map file structures. The tool should generate structured prompts for GPT-4 based on the codebase analysis.
- GPT-4 Documentation Generation: Use GPT-4 to generate documentation, FAQs, and tutorials based on the structured prompts. The AI should be able to generate Markdown-formatted content suitable for different audiences.
- Tabbed Documentation View: The app provides a tabbed view for README, API Docs, User Manual, and FAQs. Each tab renders the generated Markdown using a Markdown viewer.
- Documentation Export: Users can download the generated documentation as PDF or export it to Notion, GitBook, or Markdown.
- Regenerate Documentation Sections: Allow users to regenerate specific sections of the documentation with different tones (e.g., developer-friendly, business-friendly).
